# Dialogue-System

My goal is to create my own dialogue system for Unreal Engine. I really want to program for narrative games since I am passionate about these kinds of games. If I make a good enough then I will be able to show my capabilities in narrative programming. 

I want to make this in Unreal Engine 5 since there are already so many systems for Unity already. So the language will be in C++, for now I don't plan on using libraries or frameworks (until I find that I need them).\

For this project I want a system where you can go through dialogue, start and stop whenever you want, keep track of variables that might change based on the narrative. The main struggles will be the fact that this is in Unreal which has a lot less documentation and I have less experience in. 

At the end of the project I'll probably do a video showcase with some technical documentation to go with it.
